    "## Single Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Smolagents defines AI agents as **programs where LLM outputs directly control the workflow**. Different levels of agent autonomy and capability are possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/agents_table.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, agents rely on [tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) - defined functions that allow LLMs to interact with their environment through function execution and output observation. This enables agents to take actions and learn from their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To orchestrate this interaction, smolagents employs the [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) (Reason + Act) framework, which follows the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Phase**: User query, context, and response instructions are processed\n",
    "2. **Reasoning Phase**: LLM generates a \"thought\", planning next steps based on context\n",
    "3. **Action Phase**: LLM executes a [tool call](https://youtu.be/gMeTK6zzaO4?si=XzwYDe0cVA_hRoaZ), triggering a function, API or sequence\n",
    "4. **Observation Phase**: Tool output is returned to the LLM for processing\n",
    "5. **Loop**: Steps 2-4 repeat until either:\n",
    "   - Original question is answered\n",
    "   - Maximum steps are reached \n",
    "   - Final answer tool is called\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/ReAct.png\" width=600> \n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach is commonly used with Tool Calling Agents like ChatGPT through JSON-based responses, smolagents supports both traditional tool calling via `ToolCallingAgent` and a more powerful code-first default approach."

    "## CodeAgents\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional agent implementations use JSON-formatted function calls, where LLMs generate structured objects with function names and arguments. While functional, this approach has key limitations identified in [DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01747):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Restricted action space through fixed function sets\n",
    "2. High maintenance burden for implementing and maintaining individual actions\n",
    "3. Limited ability to compose multiple actions together\n",
    "4. No native support for intermediate state management\n",
    "5. Increased complexity in multi-step problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, smolagents enables direct code execution for tool handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/codeagent.png\" width=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated in [Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01030), code-based execution provides natural support for:\n",
    "- Control flow (if-statements, loops)\n",
    "- Data flow (variable storage, passing)\n",
    "- Tool composition (chaining actions)\n",
    "- State management (intermediate results)\n",
    "- Error handling (try/catch blocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above shows how CodeAct (top right) can handle multiple inputs in a single action through loops, while JSON/text approaches (top left) require separate actions for each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining tools as Python functions and allowing LLMs to write complete programs, smolagents offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ecosystem Integration**: Direct access to powerful [python packages](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/utils.py#L36)\n",
    "2. **Natural LLM Interaction**: Leverages models' advanced code generation and understanding capabilities\n",
    "3. **Efficient Execution**: Complex orchestration with fewer discrete actions\n",
    "4. **Robust State Management**: Variable handling for intermediate results\n",
    "5. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate error handling during execution\n",

      "4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n",
      "5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n",
      "6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n",
      "7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n",
      "8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\n",
      "9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n",
      "10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n",
      "\n",
